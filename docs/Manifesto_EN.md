# Manifesto: Open Data as Infrastructure

Open data is not a trend. It is infrastructure.

It is the difference between an economy where only the largest actors can see what is happening, and an economy where researchers, small businesses, students, journalists, developers, and public institutions work from a shared reality. When data is open, competition levels out, innovation accelerates, and opportunities are no longer reserved for those who can afford closed databases.

Central.Enterprises exists because we believe that company data must be accessible, verifiable, and useful at scale.

We are building a world where business information is not trapped behind walls, outdated PDFs, or proprietary intermediaries. A world where markets, supply chains, local economies, digital maturity, and competitive landscapes can be understood without needing a corporate contract that excludes 99% of people. A world where a startup can analyze a country with the same level of structure as a multinational, where a student researches with real data, and where a public project is validated with transparent and repeatable evidence.

This isn't about "giving things away." It's about building a standard.

Open data works when it is rigorous. When it is maintained. When it is documented. When it is structured. When it respects privacy and the law. When it is published out of responsibility and not out of exploitation.

Central.Enterprises aims to become the global reference standard for open company data, because the world needs a neutral layer of business reality: a common foundation upon which anyone can build.

A layer that is:

* Precise enough to be trusted
* Recent enough to be acted upon
* Structured enough to be processed
* Accessible enough to be universal
* Responsible enough to last

The internet is full of public signals: official websites, public listings, contact pages, descriptions, hours, aggregated reviews, categories, and digital footprints that businesses themselves publish to be found. That visibility has value. If it is public, it can help society… but only if someone transforms that noise into coherent, consistent, and reusable datasets.

That is the hard part.

Most "open business information" is messy, fragmented, or impractical for serious work. It may seem accessible, but it breaks when you try to do something real: segmentation, deduplication, normalization, change traceability, geographic reconciliation, link integrity, and quality controls over millions of records.

Central.Enterprises is designed for the low-profile work that makes open data actually work.

We come from a builders' mindset: engineering, publishing, teaching, and operating real digital products. Systems that work under real constraints (budget, time, legal limits, quality thresholds) and with a constant reality: the world changes every day.

We don't idealize data. We are obsessed with it being useful.

We believe that the future of business intelligence is not another closed database with another contract. The future is an open ecosystem where the data layer is shared, and differentiation happens in tools, analysis, services, integrations, and creativity.

Central.Enterprises is building that shared layer.

From Granada to the world, we are creating a global catalog of companies that serves economic research, data journalism, academic projects, market discovery, SEO intelligence, competition analysis, supply chain mapping, and digital transformation measurement.

We want open data to be a competitive advantage for everyone, not a privilege.

## Why open data, why now

Because the world moves too fast for closed systems.

Markets change weekly. Sectors shift month by month. Local economies evolve daily. Closures, openings, rebrandings, website migrations, and platform changes happen constantly. If data is locked away, it ages and dies. If data is open, it is tested, reused, improved, referenced, and questioned. Openness creates accountability. Accountability creates quality. Quality creates trust.

Open data also creates a multiplier effect:

* A dataset can turn into hundreds or thousands of projects.
* A publication can trigger local solutions.
* A clear structure can become a standard adopted by others.

When the standard improves, everyone wins.

## What we mean by "Open Company Data"

Open company data is not personal data. It is not about individuals or sensitive attributes. It is about companies and their public presence: the information an organization publishes to be found and that customers use to decide.

Our principle is simple: respect for privacy, respect for the law, focus on companies, and total transparency.

That means:

* We work with company-level information.
* We prioritize public signals and sources with reuse rights, and we explain it in each dataset.
* We design datasets for research and legitimate commercial use.
* We do not build invasive personal profiling.
* We document so that the data is reproducible.
* We treat quality as an engineering discipline, not a marketing promise.

And something important: if a company requests a correction or removal of information, we apply an agile and verifiable rectification mechanism. Openness without responsibility is not openness: it is noise.

## A practical vision: the global reference layer

Our goal is not to be "another database provider."

Our goal is to be the reference layer: the place people point to to understand the business reality of a city, a province, a region, a country, a sector, or an economic corridor.

We want to build the most usable open business data ecosystem in the world, not out of vanity, but out of necessity: the world needs a center of gravity that sets standards.

When we say "being a reference," we mean:

* Clarity of structure
* Consistency across regions
* Complete documentation
* Versioning and traceability
* Operational reliability
* Responsible limits

We want to publish data that other systems can depend on:

* A developer can integrate it
* A researcher can cite it
* A journalist can verify it
* A company can act on it
* An institution can reference it without reputational risk

That is infrastructure.

## What we publish and why it matters

We don't believe in vague datasets. We believe in practical datasets: structured records that reflect the real footprint of companies and that can be filtered, deduplicated, enriched, and analyzed.

A modern business dataset must represent what a business is today in the digital economy: an entity with location, category, aggregated reputation, contact surfaces, and changing web presence.

Typical fields (company, public signals, ready for analysis):

* Name and categories
* Aggregated rating and number of reviews
* Hours and public description
* Address, locality, province/administrative area, postal code, country
* Website and public profile links (where available)
* Published corporate phone number
* Coordinates and map references
* Technical metadata (capture date, version/snapshot, origin, license, quality)

Regarding content that is sensitive by nature (e.g., full review texts or emails): it will only be published when there is a clear fit with legality, reuse rights, and responsibility. The rule is to prioritize utility without crossing lines.

### Geographic data: the backbone of business analysis

There is no business intelligence without geography. Postal codes, administrative divisions, and locality mapping are the backbone of any regional analysis: segmentation, planning, resource allocation, trend mapping, economic studies.

That is why Central.Enterprises also publishes open and rigorous geographic layers as part of the ecosystem. Not as an accessory, but as a pillar.

## The publishing philosophy: "truth in snapshot form"

One of the most honest things in data is saying what you are offering.

Central.Enterprises publishes reliable snapshots of reality at a given time. This is valuable for comparing, researching, and deciding.

We don't aim to "hand-polish" every record: it would be inaccessible, expensive, and slow. The world doesn't need a perfect dataset of 10 companies. It needs a solid dataset of millions.

That is why we design for:

* Scale
* Consistency
* Repeatability
* Continuous improvement

Each dataset is published with a clear snapshot identity, release date, documentation, and, where applicable, changes from previous versions.

## How we build trust

Trust requires discipline.

Open data without discipline becomes noise. And when noise wins, the mission dies.

Central.Enterprises builds trust with engineering and publishing:

* Consistency across regions: same columns, same formats, same logic
* Deduplication: stable analysis, less distortion
* Geographic coherence: ZIP codes, provinces, and localities aligned
* Link integrity: verified websites, checkable references
* Freshness and versioning: snapshots and clear cadence
* Documentation: field dictionary, limits, examples, license, and origin
* Responsible limits: focus on the company, respect for privacy, removal/correction when appropriate

Furthermore, we believe in transparently separating mission and business: an open foundation that empowers everyone, and premium layers (tools, integrations, enrichments, automations, audits) for operational needs. A hybrid model can coexist without betraying openness if the open part remains useful, maintained, and reliable.

## Why this matters

Central.Enterprises is not a faceless project.

It is built by people who know what it's like to start from scratch, deliver under pressure, learn fast, and teach clearly. Building from Granada is not a limitation: it is a statement. Valuable infrastructure can be built anywhere if the discipline is real.

We believe in resilience, not hype. In real work, not vanity metrics.

Open data is respect: respect for those who build, for those who research, for the public, and for the idea that knowledge should not stay trapped.

And it is deeply human: when you make company data accessible, you give people leverage. You help them learn with real datasets, compete as a small player, understand local economies, and make better decisions.

Leverage changes lives.

## The future we are building

We are building a global open data engine for business information.

Country by country, sector by sector, locality by locality.

We want Central.Enterprises to feel like a modern public service for business knowledge: modern tools, modern formats, modern APIs, and an editorial philosophy based on clarity and responsibility.

We want to support:

* Open datasets for research
* Versioned and citable publications
* Formats that facilitate reuse (CSV, XLSX, structured feeds, and analysis formats)
* Documentation and examples ready to build
* An ecosystem where open and premium coexist with transparency

If we succeed, the result is bigger than one company: it will be a global layer of corporate transparency that helps society function better.

**This is the mission:**
To make open company data rigorous enough to trust, accessible enough to use, and scalable enough to matter.

We are not here to be a page. We are here to be infrastructure.

**Central.Enterprises.**
Company databases worldwide.
Built with discipline. Published with responsibility.
Open by conviction. Global by design.
